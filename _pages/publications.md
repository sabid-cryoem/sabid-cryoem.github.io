    Cryo-EM Analyses Permit Visualization of Structural Polymorphism of Biological Macromolecules
  </a>
</h3>
<strong> (Frontiers in Bioinformatics (2021)) </strong>
<p>The functions of biological macromolecules are often associated with conformational malleability of the structures. This phenomenon of chemically identical molecules with different structures is coined structural polymorphism. Conventionally, structural polymorphism is observed directly by structural determination at the density map level from X-ray crystal diffraction. Although crystallography approach can report the conformation of a macromolecule with the position of each atom accurately defined in it, the exploration of structural polymorphism and interpreting biological function in terms of crystal structures is largely constrained by the crystal packing. An alternative approach to studying the macromolecule of interest in solution is thus desirable. With the advancement of instrumentation and computational methods for image analysis and reconstruction, cryo-electron microscope (cryo-EM) has been transformed to be able to produce “in solution” structures of macromolecules routinely with resolutions comparable to crystallography but without the need of crystals. Since the sample preparation of single-particle cryo-EM allows for all forms co-existing in solution to be simultaneously frozen, the image data contain rich information as to structural polymorphism. The ensemble of structure information can be subsequently disentangled through three-dimensional (3D) classification analyses. In this review, we highlight important examples of protein structural polymorphism in relation to allostery, subunit cooperativity and function plasticity recently revealed by cryo-EM analyses, and review recent developments in 3D classification algorithms including neural network/deep learning approaches that would enable cryo-EM analyese in this regard. Finally, we brief the frontier of cryo-EM structure determination of RNA molecules where resolving the structural polymorphism is at dawn. </p>

    rAMI–Rapid Alignment with Moment of Inertia for Cryo-EM Image Processing
  </a>
</h3>
<strong> (Microscopy and Microanalysis  (2021))</strong>
<p>Moment of Inertia (MoI) as a 2 by 2 matrix I containing the central moments with order two, whose first eigenvector corresponds to the object’s orientation, has been a popular tool for image alignment (Jan, Suk and Zitová, 2016). However, the low SNR nature of cryo-EM images has prevented the direct application of MoI. We proposed an algorithm called Rapid Alignment with Moment of Inertia (rAMI), and we show that it can be widely applicable to the current alignment steps in cryo-EM.  </p>

    Cryo-Ralib - A Modular Library for Accelerating Alignment in CRYO-EM
  </a>
</h3>
<strong> (2021 IEEE International Conference on Image Process (ICIP) (2021))</strong>
<p>Thanks to GPU-accelerated processing, cryo-EM has become a rapid structure determination method that permits capture of dynamical structures of molecules in solution, which has been recently demonstrated by the determination of COVID-19 spike protein in March, shortly after its breakout in late January 2020. This rapidity is critical for vaccine development in response to the emerging pandemic. Compared to the Bayesian-based 2D classification widely used in the work-flow, the multi-reference alignment (MRA) is less popular. It is time-consuming despite its superior in differentiating structural variations. Interestingly, the Bayesian approach has higher complexity than MRA. We thereby reason that the popularity of Bayesian is gained through GPU acceleration, where a modular acceleration library for MRA is lacking. Here, we introduce a library called Cryo-RALib that expands the functionality of CUDA library used by GPU ISAC. It contains a GPU-accelerated MRA routine for accelerating MRA-based classification algorithms. In addition, we connect the cryo-EM image analysis with the python data science stack to make it easier for users to perform data analysis and visualization. Benchmarking on the TaiWan Computing Cloud (TWCC) shows that our implementation can accelerate the computation by one order of magnitude. </p>

    Quantification of model bias underlying the phenomenon of Einstein from Noise
  </a>
</h3>
<strong> (Academia Sinica  (2021))</strong>
<p>“Einstein from Noise” states a pitfall in cryo-electron microscopy analysis that a processing output could be heavily biased towards the imposed model. We develop a simple mathematical framework under which an image is expressed as a vector of dimension p where p is large and show how the bias is formed by averaging a properly chosen set of purely noise images that are most highly correlated with the target image. </p>

    Pre-Pro: a Fast Pre-Processor for Single-Particle Cryo-EMthrough Enhancing 2D Classification
  </a>
</h3>
<strong>(Communications Biology (2020))</strong>
<p>2D classification plays a pivotal role in analyzing single particle cryo-electron microscopy images. Itis mainly used to curate cryo-EM images by harvesting good particle datasets by separating good par-ticles from bad ones or non-particle contaminants. Due largely to the presence of heavy noise, theclassification results are often non-ideal while the computation burden is further aggravated by recentexpansion in size and number of images. Here, we introduce a simple and loss-less pre-processor thatincorporates a fast dimension-reduction (2SDR) de-noiser to enhance 2D classification. By implement-ing this 2SDR pre-processor prior to representative classification algorithms including RELION andISAC, we compare the performances with and without the pre-processor. Tests on multiple cryo-EMexperimental datasets show the pre-processor can make the classification faster, improve the yield ofparticles, and increase the number of good classes to generate better initial models. Testing on thenanodisc-embedded TRPV1 dataset with high heterogeneity with a 3D reconstruction workflow usingthe initial model generated by class-averages, we found that the pre-processor improved the resolutionto 2.82 Å toward the Nyquist frequency. Those findings and analyses suggest the 2SDR de-noiser, ofminimal cost, is widely applicable for boosting the performances of 2D classification algorithms. Thegeneralization of the pre-processing strategy to accommodate neural network de-noisers is discussed. </p>

    Two-stage dimension reduction for noisy high-dimensional images and application to Cryogenic Electron Microscopy
  </a>
</h3>
<strong>(Annals of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (2020))</strong>
<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is arguably the most widely used dimension-reduction method for vector-type data. When applied to a sample of images, PCA requires vectorization of the image data, which in turn entails solving an eigenvalue problem for the sample covariance matrix. We propose herein a two-stage dimension reduction (2SDR) method for image reconstruction from high-dimensional noisy image data. The first stage treats the image as a matrix, which is a tensor of order 2, and uses multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) for matrix rank reduction and image denoising. The second stage vectorizes the reduced-rank matrix and achieves further dimension and noise reduction. Simulation studies demonstrate excellent performance of 2SDR, for which we also develop an asymptotic theory that establishes consistency of its rank selection. Applications to cryo-EM (cryogenic electronic microscopy), which has revolutionized structural biology, organic and medical chemistry, cellular and molecular physiology in the past decade, are also provided and illustrated with benchmark cryo-EM datasets. Connections to other contemporaneous developments in image reconstruction and high-dimensional statistical inference are also discussed.

    On asymptotic normality of cross data matrix-based PCA in high dimension low sample size
  </a>
</h3>
<strong>(Journal of Multivariate Analysis (2020))</strong>
<p>Principal component analysis in high dimension low sample size setting has been an active research area in recent years. Yata and Aoshima (2010) proposed a cross data matrix-based method and showed the asymptotic normality for estimates of spiked eigenvalues and also consistency for corresponding estimates of PC directions. However, the asymptotic normality for estimates of PC directions is still lacking. In this article, we have extended Yata and Aoshima (2010)’s work to include the investigation of the asymptotic normality for the leading CDM-based PC directions and to compare it with the asymptotic normality for the classical PCA. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the asymptotic normality.

The generalized degrees of freedom of multilinear principal component analysis
  </a>
</h3>
<strong>(Journal of Multivariate Analysis (2019))</strong>
<p>Tensor data, such as image set, movie data, gene-environment interactions, or gene–gene interactions, have become a popular data format in many fields. Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) has been recognized as an efficient dimension reduction method for tensor data analysis. However, a gratifying rank selection method for a general application of MPCA is not yet available. For example, both the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), arguably two of the most commonly used model selection methods, require more strict model assumptions when applying on the rank selection in MPCA.
